"iterate over a range of integers"
something like: int(a).through(int(b)) do |Local| Item
  
  creates an Enumerator
  @index starts at int(a)
  @index ends at int(b)
  every step:
    binds local:=int as a Variable
    increments index
    produces [self(updated), Variable, Item] in that order



"iterate over a range of Decimals"
something like: decimal(a).through(decimal(b)).int(c).times do |Local| Item

    creates an Enumerator
    @index starts at decimal(a)
    @index ends at decimal(b)
    @increment is |b-a|/int(c)
    every step:
      binds local:=@index as a Variable
      increments index by one increment
      produces [self(updated), Variable, Item] in that order


"iterate over the elements of a list"
something like: list.each do |local| Item
  
  creates an Enumerator
  no @index used
  every step:
    snips off first (remaining) element of list
    binds local:=element as a Variable
    produces [self(updated), Variable, Item]
