Duck is a language designed to be used in genetic programming. It's an (extreme) variation on [Lee Spector and Maarten Keijzer's Push] (http://push.i3ci.hampshire.edu/), but has ended up much closer in spirit to the exotic concatenative language [XY] (http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm).


### Duck language features:

* integer arithmetic
* stack-based, like Forth or Push
* concatenative, like XY
* uses duck-typing to map arguments to function calls, not static types
* uses first-class functions and partial application
