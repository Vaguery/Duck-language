Duck is a language designed to be used in genetic programming. It's an (extreme) variation on [Lee Spector and Maarten Keijzer's Push] (http://push.i3ci.hampshire.edu/), but has ended up much closer in spirit to the exotic concatenative language [XY] (http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm).

Duck:
  * is stack-based, like Forth or Push
  * is concatenative, like XY
  * uses duck-typing to map arguments to function calls
  * uses partial application of functions

Core language features:
  * integer arithmetic
